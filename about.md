The Emerging Technologies Laboratory (the ETL), based in the
[Department of Computer Science](http://cs.luc.edu) at
[Loyola University Chicago](http://luc.edu), is a collective effort to
create, extend, and adapt best-of-class computer technologies. We
foster innovation by encouraging experimentation and
collaboration. The ideas that emerge are developed with the intent of
making a significant contribution to the computing community. Whilst
we are based at Loyola University Chicago, we welcome participation
from anyone who is interested in experimental computing.
